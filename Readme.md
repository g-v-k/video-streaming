This is an example illustrating video streaming like Youtube in Nodejs.

"node run build" for building the project as this is a typescript project
"node start" for starting the server.

Go to localhost:3000/ to load the index page. This automatically calls "/video" endpoint and receives chunks of video data to stream.
